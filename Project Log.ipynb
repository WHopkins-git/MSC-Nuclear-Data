    "- Conducted a review of literature on neutron-induced cross sections to gain a deeper understanding of the current methodologies in nuclear data evaluation.\n",
    "- Started examining how machine learning could augment the process of nuclear data evaluation.\n",
    "- Retrieved neutron capture data for U-233 from the National Nuclear Data Center using their online interface. Successfully replicated the data retrieval process programmatically using Python.\n",
    "- Established a GitHub repository to facilitate version control and access to Jupyter Notebook files for supervisory review and collaboration\n",
    "- Utilized both the online interface and Python for data visualization of specified nuclear data.\n",
    "- Advanced the Python scripts by generalizing them into reusable methods to be available for future work.\n",
    "- Initiated the creation of a detailed project log document. This log is hosted on a publicly accessible GitHub repository, ensuring transparency, supervisory monitoring and availability for external stakeholders.\n",
    "- Began literature assessment of possible areas we could take the project beyond the initial paper replication."
